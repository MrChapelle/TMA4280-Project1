this is the read me files associated to Project 2

to execute a program you have to change his name in the CMakeList.txt file
just change the name of source code : poisson.c / poisson_mpi.c / poisson_hybrid.c

then : 

module load gcc
module load openmpi 

make clean

CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

gmake

then :

mpirun -np X ./poisson n Y 

to execute it on X processes , Y threads and with a matrix size of n

maybe mpiexec also works ..
