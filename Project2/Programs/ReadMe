This is the read me files associated to Project 2

To execute a program you have to change his name in the CMakeList.txt file
just change the name of source code : poisson.c / poisson_mpi.c / poisson_hybrid.c

Then : 

module load gcc
module load openmpi 

make clean

CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

gmake

Then :

mpirun -np X ./poisson n Y 

to execute it on X processes , Y threads and with a matrix size of n

maybe mpiexec also works ..

notes:
if you're running poisson_mpi , you don't put Y, argc has a size equal to 1
if you're running poisson , just write ./poisson n
if you're running poisson_hybrid , follow the instruction written before
