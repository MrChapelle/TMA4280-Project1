Grid size: n = 1024, World size = 6, Rows per process: m = 170, Set number of threads: t = 4
Number of processes is not a power of 2. Aborting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 2 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 12.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
